# Chromatography

## Overview

Chromatography is a technique used to separate and analyze complex mixtures of compounds. The Hartree-Fock method is 
a quantum model that calculates the properties of molecular systems.

In this project, we use the Hartree-Fock method to calculate the properties of molecular systems and display 
the results graphically.

## Features

`Chromatography` which consists of three main modules :

* Calculation of properties of molecular systems using the Hartree-Fock method
* Command Line Interface module to launch calculations and display results
* Graphic User Interface  module to visualize the results of calculations
